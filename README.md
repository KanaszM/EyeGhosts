# Ghosts of an Eye!

## Description

To prepare myself for the Global Game Jam 2025🌐(my very first game jam), I set myself a personal challenge: *to create a game in just two days*. This was my way of getting into the right mindset for the event. And this is the result 😁

The game was developed using **Godot v4.4.dev3.official**. [An online web version is available on Itch.io and can be played here](https://kanaszm.itch.io/ghosts-of-an-eye).

> ⚠️ Please note that due to certain limitations, shaders are not
> functional in the web version. I highly recommend playing the Windows release version available in this repository for the best experience.

Given the time constraints, the game currently lacks the following features:

-   Sounds and music;
-   Options and settings;
-   Difficulty levels and greater variation in challenges;
-   Colorblind mode;
-   A story and a more defined end-game conclusion.

> ℹ️ This project taught me a lot about rapid prototyping, managing scope,
> and creative problem-solving within tight deadlines.

## How to Play

Defend the eye's center from approaching ghosts by intercepting them with your `mouse cursor`.
To block a ghost successfully, your cursor must match its color.
Switch your cursor's color by pressing the `left or right mouse buttons`.
The game ends when the timer runs out.
You can pause the game anytime by pressing `ESC`.

## Future Plans

Currently, there are no immediate plans for further development of this project. However, feedback is always welcome! If there’s interest in a more polished and expanded version, I’d be excited to work on it.
